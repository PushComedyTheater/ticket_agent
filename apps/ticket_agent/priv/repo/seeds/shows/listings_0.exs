The group puts on a racy, high-octane, energetic show that is guaranteed to have audiences howling with laughter. In November of 2014, they opened their own theater, The Push Comedy Theater, located in the new Norfolk Arts District.
</p>
<p>In 2013 The Pushers' Off-Broadway musical Cuff Me: The Unauthorized Fifty Shades of Grey Musical Parody debuted in New York City. It ran for over a year in both New York and Chicago. A third production is currently touring the country.
</p>
<p>The Pushers have appeared at both The Charleston Comedy Festival and The North Carolina Comedy Arts Festival. In New York, they have performed at The People's Improv Theater, The Upright Citizen's Brigade and at The Kraine Theater in New York's East Village.
</p>
<p>Here in Hampton Roads the group have performed most notably at The Jewish Mother, The NorVa and The Virginia Beach Funnybone.

</p>
<p>The Pushers have appeared at both The Charleston Comedy Festival and The North Carolina Comedy Arts Festival. In New York, they have performed at The People's Improv Theater, The Upright Citizen's Brigade and at The Kraine Theater in New York's East Village.

<p>The Harold is the big, bad grand daddy of all long form improv! It starts with an audience suggestion, then improvisers weave together scenes, characters and group games to create a seamless piece. It can be bizarre and magical, baffling and amazing... it definitely needs to be seen.
