<p>The Pushers have appeared at both The Charleston Comedy Festival and The North Carolina Comedy Arts Festival. In New York, they have performed at The People's Improv Theater, The Upright Citizen's Brigade and at The Kraine Theater in New York's East Village.
</p>
<p>Here in Hampton Roads the group have performed most notably at The Jewish Mother, The NorVa and The Virginia Beach Funnybone.
