<p>The Pushers are Virginia's premiere sketch and improv comedy group. For nearly ten years they have thrilled (and shocked) audiences with their wild antics both on and off stage. The group puts on a racy, high-octane, energetic show that is guaranteed to have audiences howling with laughter. This fall they opened their own theater, The Push Comedy Theater, located in the new Norfolk Arts District.
</p>
<p>In 2013 The Pushers' Off-Broadway musical Cuff Me: The Unauthorized Fifty Shades of Grey Musical Parody debuted in New York City. It ran for over a year in both New York and Chicago. A third production is currently touring the country.
</p>
<p>The Pushers have appeared at both The Charleston Comedy Festival and The North Carolina Comedy Arts Festival. In New York, they have performed at The People's Improv Theater, The Upright Citizen's Brigade and at The Kraine Theater in New York's East Village.
</p>
<p>Here in Hampton Roads the group have performed most notably at The Jewish Mother, The NorVa and The Virginia Beach Funnybone.

    <h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>The Magic Negro and Other Blackness</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: center;">Have you ever pondered the idea that Dr. Seuss’ <em>Green Eggs and Ham</em> might be racially charged? Is it possible to skip and listen to hip hop at the same time? Do black people actually carry around race cards? Well, maybe it’s time to take a closer look.
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Mark Kendall uses a series of comedic sketches to examine the representation of black males in the media in his critically acclaimed one-man show.  From prison to white flight, and even Reading Rainbow – we’ll explore some of the ways these images influence our views on race in everyday life. There will also be cookies.
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i>Mark first got into comedy while studying film at Northwestern University. He had a chance to work at Comedy Central through the Chris Rock Summer School Program for up and coming comedy writers of color. During his time at Comedy Central, he got to pitch jokes to the writing staffs of "The Daily Show" and "The Colbert Report." Mark performs comedy in Atlanta at Dad's Garage Theatre Company and Highwire Comedy. He also teaches improv and sketch writing. He is currently touring with his one man show "The Magic Negro and Other Blackness" a sketch show that examines the depiction of black men in the media. For his work with the show, he was named "Best Professional Funny Man" by Creative Loafing Atlanta.</i>

<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>The Reformed Whores</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: center;">If Dolly Parton &amp; Flight of the Conchords got drunk and had a baby, you'd get the hilariously irreverent musical comedy duo Reformed Whores! These All-American gals don’t beat around the bush as they skewer and celebrate country music at their rib-tickling hoedown. Southern bred, but NYC based, Katy Frame &amp; Marie Cecile Anderson have been featured on IFC, PBS, CBS, and many other three-letter networks.
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">They've toured the country opening for the likes of musical parodist "Weird Al" Yankovic, bassist extraordinaire Les Claypool, guitar hero Dweezil Zappa and rockabilly vets Reverend Horton Heat. Their sophomore album "Don't Beat Around the Bush" debuted in March 2016 on the top 20 iTunes comedy chart and their YouTube Channel just hit over a million views!
